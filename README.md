Resilience Soul is a web-based anti-depression platform designed to support users in managing their mental health. It offers core features like user registration and login, an admin dashboard for user management, mood tracking, diary entries, and articles. Users can log their moods, write personal diary entries, and access curated articles, while administrators oversee user activities and manage platform content.
Built using Laravel's MVC architecture, the platform includes controllers to manage core functionalities, models to define relationships (e.g., Users, Articles, Moods, Diaries), and Blade templates for user-friendly interfaces. The database structure is well-organized with migrations for essential tables like `users`, `articles`, `moods`, and `diaries`. With its modular design, Resilience Soul is an effective, scalable, and user-centric solution to support mental health and well-being.
